            >My name is Rachael Gbodume, my love for technology began in 2019
            when I resigned from my job as a sales girl to start up something
            related to social media management. My first client was an IT
            company looking to boost sales online. Coming into their office each
            day, I began developing interest in understanding web and mobile
            developement. I could say, before 2019, my love for technology was 5
            out of 10, today it's a definite 10 out of 10.</i

            >In my few weeks in Stutern, I have learnt how to create a
            repository and I'm very comfortable with pushing and pulling from
            github, this is ofcourse after many back and forths with my tutors
            Chisom and Peter. I also understood HTML as the structure of a web
            page and how important it is to use the right flow so any developer
            who takes a look at my code can easily understand it. I'm not going
            to lie, using CSS was quite confusing at the begining, infact, I
            almost mixed up inline css as beign part of HTML. However, the
            introductory lessons of CSS taken so far has allowed me to
            understand the triplicate styling and helped me to identify which
            type of css I'm using at any given point (Inline, Internal or
            External). I've also come to understand that selectors can be
            universal(*), repetitive or unique to the tags it's linked to.
            However, I need to bear in mind the importance of specificity as
            this is what my browser will be focused on when trying to translate
            / read my code.</i

            >Padding is used to create space around an element's content, inside
            of any defined borders. Padding properties are specific to position
            which is usually either top, right, bottom and left. Margin is.
            Margins are used to create space around elements, outside of an
            already defined border. Just as Padding, maring properties are also
            specific to location which is also usually either top, right, bottom
            and left. CSS Border allows the developer specify the style, width
            and color of the border surronding a specific element. Border style
            property values include: dotted, dashed, solid, doubled, groove,
            ridge, inset, outset, none, hidden and mix.</i
